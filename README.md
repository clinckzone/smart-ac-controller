# smart-ac-controller
The repository contains the scripts that were used in the development of the controller. The 'hardware' script was uploaded on the Arduino, while the one named 'software' was run as a Processing program on Raspberry Pi. Additionally, the 'codeDumper' script was used first to get the IR Codes for the AC remote controller which was then copy pasted inside the 'hardware' script so that it could successfully command the AC as a controller.
